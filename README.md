My first microprocessor
=====
This is my first attempt at making a microprocessor.

Goals:
- As few instructions as possible.
- 8 bit data bus.
- 16 bit address bus.
- Memory mapped display adapter
- Memory mapped keyboard interface.
- Emulator.
- Basic simulation.
- Hardware implementation with TTL chips.
